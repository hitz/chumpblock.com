It's a meta 0.  You can always get [c]Rakshasha's Secret[/c] in packs 2 or 3.    The problem is that it's too expensive unless you delve for it.  But if you have a delve deck (i..,e have fuel early) then you should be focused on REAL delve spells (of which this is the absolutely worst, perhaps barring [c]temporal tresspass[/c])  OR you are going to cast it late... when they don't have any cards!!!!

I would rather play [c]Sultai Runemark[/c] than this (but I would rather play Secret over Runemark).

OK - there are about a 8 cards that I could conceive of playing this against.
Channel Harm (uncommon), Flying Crane Technique, Mob Rule, Empty the Pits, Vilianous Wealth, Ugin, Supplant Form and Silumgar.
I would hope that you would not have to bring it in against the non-hexproof dragons.

0.5, tentatively.
